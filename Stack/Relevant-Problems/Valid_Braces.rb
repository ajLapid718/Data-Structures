# Write a function called validBraces that takes a string of braces, and determines if the order of the braces is valid. validBraces should return true if the string is valid, and false if it's invalid.
#
# This Kata is similar to the Valid Parentheses Kata, but introduces four new characters. Open and closed brackets, and open and closed curly braces. Thanks to @arnedag for the idea!
#
# All input strings will be nonempty, and will only consist of open parentheses '(' , closed parentheses ')', open brackets '[', closed brackets ']', open curly braces '{' and closed curly braces '}'.
#
# What is considered Valid? A string of braces is considered valid if all braces are matched with the correct brace.
# For example:
# '(){}[]' and '([{}])' would be considered valid, while '(}', '[(])', and '[({})](]' would be considered invalid.
#
# Examples:
# validBraces( "(){}[]" ) => returns true
# validBraces( "(}" ) => returns false
# validBraces( "[(])" ) => returns false
# validBraces( "([{}])" ) => returns true

BRACES = { "{" => "}", "[" => "]", "(" => ")" }

def validBraces(braces)
  stack = []

  braces.chars.each do |brace|
    stack << brace if BRACES.key?(brace)
    return false if BRACES.key(brace) && BRACES.key(brace) != stack.pop
  end

  stack.empty?
end

# Alternatively

def validBraces(braces)
  pairs = {
    ")" => "(",
    "]" => "[",
    "}" => "{"
  }

  stack = []

  braces.chars.each { |par|
    case par
      when "(", "[", "{" then stack << par
      when ")", "]", "}" then return false if stack.pop != pairs[par]
    end
  }

  stack.empty?
end

# Preferred Solution

BRACES = {
  "(" => ")",
  "{" => "}",
  "[" => "]"
}
 
OPENING_BRACES = BRACES.keys
CLOSING_BRACES = BRACES.values
 
def validBraces(braces)
  stack  = []
 
  braces.chars.each do |element|
    if OPENING_BRACES.include?(element)
      stack << element
    else
      if BRACES[stack.last] == element
        stack.pop

# Preferred Solution Annotated

CLOSING_BRACES = BRACES.values
 
def validBraces(braces)
  stack  = []
 
  braces.chars.each do |element|
    if OPENING_BRACES.include?(element) # We'll accept most (we'll catch a terminal opening brace toward the end) opening braces to start the comparisons/pair checking
      stack << element # An opening brace is now at the top of the stack (ideally)
    else # In the event of a closing brace...
      if BRACES[stack.last] == element # ...we compare the closing brace (element) to BRACES[stack.last] which will output a value (the closer counterpart) from a key-value pair in the BRACES hash
        stack.pop # We remove from the top of the stack if this closing brace correctly pairs
      else # If the element is a closing brace AND it does not pair then...
        return false #...return false. This is necessary in the case when an unopened closing brace remains validBraces("())") or validBraces("()]")
      end
    end
  end

  stack.empty? # If the stack is empty, then that means that everything paired successfully (everything was correctly popped and everything that wasn't supposed to enter did not enter), hence they were valid braces.

# Explanation via GeeksForGeeks.org

# Algorithm:

# 1) Declare a character stack S.
# 2) Now traverse the expression string exp.
#     a) If the current character is a starting bracket (‘(‘ or ‘{‘ or ‘[‘) then push it to stack.
#     b) If the current character is a closing bracket (‘)’ or ‘}’ or ‘]’) then pop from stack and if the popped character is the matching starting bracket then fine...else the parentheses are not balanced.
# 3) After complete traversal, if there is some starting bracket left in stack then it is “not balanced”
